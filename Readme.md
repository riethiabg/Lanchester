# Lanchester Equations

The English engineer Frederick William Lanchester in 1916 and Russian military officer Mikhail Osipov in 1915 independently proposed a model of mutual attrition of two fighting forces by a set of ordinary differential equations. The Lanchester equations can model attrition of forces in combat, they set the casualty rate for an army as a function of the size of each army. The state variables represent fighting entities in the battlefield, and each of the differential equations capture the rate of decrease in a certain state variable as a function of the other state variables. These models were inspired by air-combat scenarios in World War I. 

Lanchester’s Second Linear Law is used for unaimed fires, where a military indiscriminately shells large swathes of land rather than specifically targeting enemy forces. In this case, the casualty rate scales with the number of firers and the number of targets. Lanchester’s Square Law is used for modern militaries that are concentrating their forces and targeting specific enemies. For this case, the casualty rate scales with the number of firers.

The models are implemented with Vensim and NetLogo.
